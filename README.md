# 🧠 Bleau.Info Statistics API
This API provides statistical data for bouldering repetitions in the Fontainebleau area. All data is extracted from bleau.info. It exposes multiple endpoints to query repetition counts, grades, monthly activity, and other metrics. It is designed to be consumed by a frontend interface (e.g., React) and optimized for read-only access in production.

## 🚀 Features
Access statistical bouldering data by area, grade, and time
Clean architecture with SQLAlchemy and Pydantic
Read-only database support (SQLite)

## 📦 Tech Stack
* Backend Framework: FastAPI
* ORM: SQLAlchemy
* Database: SQLite (local)
